    Click <strong>"+ Add Group"</strong> to add a new group comparison (e.g., Road Transport, Power Stations, Domestic Combustion).<br>
    You can add up to <strong>10 groups</strong> to compare at once.<br>
To remove a group, click <strong>"− Remove Group"</strong> next to it (this appears when two or more groups are selected).

  <p class="italic text-sm text-gray-600">
    💡 Tip: You can re-order the group boxes by clicking and dragging the ⠿ handle next to each group — the chart updates automatically.
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">3️⃣ Set the Year Range</h3>
  <p>
    Use the <strong>Start Year</strong> and <strong>End Year</strong> dropdowns to focus on a particular time period.<br>
    The chart will automatically refresh to show data for the chosen range.
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">4️⃣ View and Interact with the Chart</h3>
  <p>
    Once you've chosen your pollutant, groups, and years, the interactive line chart will appear.<br>
    <strong>Hover</strong> over any point on the chart to see detailed information including group name, year, and emission value with appropriate decimal precision (automatically adjusted for very small values).<br>
    The <strong>Y-axis</strong> shows total emissions, including units (e.g., kilotonnes).<br>
    Each group is shown in a unique colour.
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">5️⃣ Use the Legend to Toggle Lines</h3>
  <p>
    Above the chart, the legend lists all groups and their corresponding colours.<br>
    <strong>Click a group name</strong> in the legend to hide or show that group's line on the chart.<br>
    Faded items indicate hidden or unavailable data.<br>
    <em>(Groups labelled "(No data available)" are included for reference but contain no plotted values.)</em>
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">6️⃣ Smooth or Straight Lines</h3>
  <p>
    Click the <strong>"🚫 Disable Smoothing"</strong> button to switch to straight (non-curved) lines.<br>
    Click again (the button will change to <strong>"✅ Enable Smoothing"</strong>) to re-enable smooth, curved lines.
