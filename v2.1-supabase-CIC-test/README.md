NAEI Multi-Group Pollutant Viewer

This interactive viewer provides a simplified interface to explore grouped emissions data from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI).
Users can select pollutants, time ranges, and multiple emission source groups to compare historical emission trends.

The data is aggregated into thematic groups (e.g. “Ecodesign Stoves”, “Power Stations”, “Road Transport”) to make national emission patterns easier to visualise and interpret.
