How to Read This Bubble Chart

The chart uses data published by the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI), combining one or more sources and fuel types into groups to make it easier to compare how much pollution is released nationally from different sources, relative to how much heat/energy they produce . 

Each bubble represents a pollution source. All bubbles are for the same type of pollutant. 

The horizontal position (left to right) shows how much energy it produced in 2023 (measured in terajoules, or TJ).

The vertical position (up and down) shows the total amount of a pollutant released (for example, PM2.5, a tiny particle that affects air quality).

The size of each bubble shows how polluting that source is for every unit of energy — its emission factor (in grams per gigajoule, g/GJ). Bigger bubbles mean higher emissions per unit of energy.

In the default view:

The Ecodesign Stove - Ready to Burn group produces far less total energy than Gas Boilers, but its bubble is much larger, showing that for every bit of energy, it gives off much more PM2.5.

Gas Boilers create far more total energy but have a very small bubble, meaning they emit much less pollution per unit of energy.

Some sources in the NAEI data do not have heat/energy (Activity Data), so have been not been included in the bubble chart. The line chart shows their emissions where available. 

The Group Info tab shows which groups do not have Activity Data, and also contains the sources and fuel types of the groups, including NFR Codes if applicable.
